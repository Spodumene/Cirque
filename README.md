# Cirque
What is Cirque? Cirque is a new KAGIC Addon that adds new gems meant to help you do things but some of them will entertain you!

## Plans
Main Release 1 Circus:
* Gadolinite - An entertainer gem that plays music and displays holograms at night
* Covelite - The first circus themed gem! She will be found in circus tents (an unimplemented feature). She can easily and swiftly attack entities. She acts as the leader of the entertainment gems!
* Labradorite - A gem that acts as a great companion. She will be the first corruptable gem.
* Corrupted Labradorite - A corrupted gem that is a giant dog! She is the first non-hostile corrupted gem, as she will be tameable due to her memories of loyalty still remaining.
* Tugtupite - A gem known as the circus' "bearded lady". She has abnormal features including two mouths. Seeing her amuses the diamonds because she isn't defective, and that this is her normal form.

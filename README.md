# Cirque
What is Cirque? Cirque is a new KAGIC Addon that adds new gems meant to help you do things but some of them will entertain you!

## Features
* Covellite - The first circus themed gem! She will be found in circus tents (an unimplemented feature). She can easily and swiftly attack entities. She acts as the leader of the entertainment gems!

## Plans
Main Release 1 Freak Show and Circus:
* Gadolinite - An entertainer gem that plays homeworld music. Her gem glows at night
* Tugtupite - A gem known as Cirque's "bearded lady". She has abnormal features including two mouths. Seeing her amuses the diamonds because she isn't defective, and that this is her normal form.
* Indicolite - A small gem that can jump very high. She acts like an acrobat.
* Moonstone - A beautiful gem that cannot speak or make noise. 

Main Release 2 Paranormal:
* Spirit Quartz - A gem that can put the gem in spectator mode, or ghost mode.
* Painite - A gem that hypnotizes rebels into serving you again. If she rebels, she can hypnotize the player and remove random items from the player's inventory.
* Glass - A gem that summons duplicates of itself. Its gem lies inside of its body.
* Morganite - A pink gem that can levitate the player.
* Pyrrhotite - A gem that can attract items to itself within a certain radius.
